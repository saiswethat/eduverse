Samples are useful examples of high-quality resumes used in your industry and for your job title. While there are many ways you can use resume samples, there are three main takeaways to look for:Simplicity. Resume samples are straightforward because employers have minimal time to review your resume, so readability is key.Brevity. You may notice that each section of the resume sample is short and to the point, including the summary and experience descriptions. Including only the most key and relevant information means employers can consume more information about you and quickly understand your fitness for the role.Numbers. You might also notice that there are often metrics in the experience section of resume samples because employers are highly responsive to measurable proven value. For example, one bullet point under the experience description for an administrative assistant reads, Processed 100 vendor contracts and implemented a standardized process, reducing contract discrepancies by 90%.",
